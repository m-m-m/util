    <section name="About MMM">
      <p>The Multi-Media-Manager (MMM) is a generic application plattform and a enterprise content management system (ECMS) with custom modules for multi-media management build on top.</p>
      <subsection name="Codex">
        <p>
	MMM is entirely written in JAVA. It makes extensive use of the JAVA 5 language.
	All code is written with focus on design &amp; quality and comes with detailed API
	documentation.<br/>
	The application is heavily based on the idioms separation of concerns (SoC) and
	inversion of control (IoC) and therefore split into tiny components. This open
	architecture allows any component implementation to be reused (by other projects)
	or be replaced.
	</p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Project State">
        <p>
	Even though the project exists for 5 years now, there is no CMS and no multi-media
	management available. If you are looking for open, flexible and well-designed software
	components (configuration, user-interface, container framework, etc.) or you want to
	get involved and let the vision of MMM become reality then you are at the right place.
