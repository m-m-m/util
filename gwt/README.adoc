This module is part of the link:../[mmm-util project] and brings GWT support for various of the `mmm-util-*` modules:

* GWT support for our great native-language-support (NLS) from link:../core[mmm-util-core].
* GWT support for http://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] briding to https://github.com/fredsa/gwt-log[gwt-log] to use logging in shared code without depending on GWT.
* GWT support for POJO introspection from link:../pojo[mmm-util-pojo].
* GWT support for lots of other stuff from link:../pojo[mmm-util-core].
* http://m-m-m.github.io/maven/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/gwt/api/package-summary.html#package.description[GWT API] with some nice additional features.
