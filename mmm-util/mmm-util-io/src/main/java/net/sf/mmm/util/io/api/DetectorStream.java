/**
 * This is the abstract base interface for a container of a wrapped stream together with metadata that is
 * detected while streaming the data.<br>
 * If a reasonable application transfers data from a source to a sink it does NOT load the entire data into
 * memory but uses streams ( {@link java.io.InputStream} and {@link java.io.OutputStream}). A typical example
 * is a file that is uploaded via HTTP and written into a database. In many situations it is desirable to get
 * metadata (e.g. mimetype, md5sum, etc.) about the actual data. Most solutions to detect metadata need random
 * access to seek in the data. Therefore you would need to save the data to a temporary file, analyze it and
 * then transfer the file to the database.<br>
 * The {@link DetectorStream} allows you to get the metadata on the fly while streaming that data. All you
 * need to do is to create a wrapper on your stream and perform your actual transfer on the wrapper stream
 * instead. This interface is the container for the wrapper stream.<br>
 * This approach requires that you read/write your data completely (at least until the detection is
 * {@link #isDone() done}).<br>
 * A {@link DetectorStream} is typically used to get the actual wrapper stream, read/write the stream data and
 * then {@link #getMetadata() get the metadata}. After this, the object is useless and can be disposed by the
 * garbage collector.
