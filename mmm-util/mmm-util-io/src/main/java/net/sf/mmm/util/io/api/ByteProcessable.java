/**
 * This is the interface for an object providing data represented as sequence of <code>byte</code>s -
 * typically some sort of buffer.<br>
 * Following the idiom <em>separations of concerns</em> the idea is to allow fast and easy
 * {@link ByteProcessor#process(byte[], int, int) processing} of the data without any dependency or knowledge
 * of the internals of this data-provider.<br>
 * The user of this API can implement a {@link ByteProcessor} (e.g. as anonymous or inner class) with its
 * custom logic. He is entirely independent from the underlying implementation of this interface that may use
 * one big byte-array to store the provided data or have it sliced into multiple smaller byte-arrays.

   * This method processes the number of bytes given by <code>length</code> (as far as available) using the
   * given <code>processor</code>.
   * 
   * @param processor is the {@link ByteProcessor} called to process the bytes. It may be called multiple
   *        types if the data is sliced into multiple byte-arrays.
   * @param length is the desired number of bytes to process. The value has to be greater or equal to
   *        <code>0</code>. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect. If you want to process all
   *        available data to the end of stream or buffer you may use {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}.
   * @return the number of bytes that have actually been processed. For a sufficient <code>length</code> this
   *         will typically be equal to <code>length</code>. However if the end of the data has been reached,
   *         a smaller value is returned. The value will always be greater or equal to <code>0</code>.
