   * To prevent waste of memory, you should NOT use a lookahead higher than necessary. However you should NOT

   * the ASCII-bytes '&lt;?xml' or '&lt;html'. Therefore he requires a lookahead of 5. If he consumes all data
   * until a '&lt;' is reached (@see {@link DetectorStreamBuffer#peek()}), he can check if 4 more bytes are
   * available. In that case he can consume all these bytes and make its decision. Otherwise he returns from
   * {@link DetectorStreamProcessor#process(DetectorStreamBuffer, java.util.Map, boolean)} and waits for the
   * next call that will guarantee the buffer is refilled with at least the specified lookahead.<br>
