/**
 * This is the interface for a processor that can be plugged into a
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.io.api.DetectorStream}. Such {@link net.sf.mmm.util.io.api.DetectorStream} holds a
 * chain of {@link DetectorStreamProcessor}s and routes the stream data through this chain.<br>
 * At the head of this chain is the producer of the data (the native {@link java.io.InputStream} or the caller
 * that wants to write to the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.io.api.DetectorStreamProvider#wrapOutputStream(java.io.OutputStream) wrapped}
 * {@link java.io.OutputStream}). The end of the chain is the consumer of the data (the native
 * {@link java.io.OutputStream} or caller that wants to read from the
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.io.api.DetectorStreamProvider#wrapInputStream(java.io.InputStream) wrapped}
 * {@link java.io.InputStream}).<br>
 * An implementation of this interface can detect information (typically metadata) from the streamed data.
 * Additionally it is possible to manipulate the streamed data by {@link DetectorStreamBuffer#remove(long)
 * removing} data from the stream and/or {@link DetectorStreamBuffer#insert(net.sf.mmm.util.io.api.ByteArray)
 * inserting} new data into the stream.<br>

  /**
   * This method performs the actual detection and optionally manipulates the data. All this happens via the
   * given <code>buffer</code> that provides access to read buffered parts of the stream. As streams are
   * typically larger pieces of data, this method will be called repetitive in order to process the entire
   * stream.<br>
   * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
   * A legal implementation of this interface has to consume data from the given <code>buffer</code> whenever
   * it is invoked. To ensure your implementation can always make an appropriate decision it may have to
   * ensure a specific {@link DetectorStreamProcessorFactory#getLookaheadCount() lookahead}.
   * 
   * @param buffer allows you to read parts of the streamed data as well as to manipulate the data.
   * @param metadata is the {@link Map} with the meta-data.
   * @param eos - <code>true</code> if the end of the stream has been reached and the given
   *        <code>buffer</code> has to be
   * @throws IOException in case of an Input/Output error. Should only be used internally.
