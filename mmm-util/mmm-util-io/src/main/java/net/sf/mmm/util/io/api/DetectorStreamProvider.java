 * This is the interface of a service that provides {@link DetectorStream detector-streams}. <br>
 * Typical usage might look like this (the cast is a little stupid but just to make it clear):
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   {@link DetectorStreamProvider} provider = ...
 *   OutputStream outStream = ...
 * 
 *   //writeData(outStream);
 *   //outStream.close();
 * 
 *   {@link DetectorOutputStream} detectorOutStream = provider.wrap(outStream, detector);
 *   {@link OutputStream} wrappedOutStream = detectorOutStream.{@link DetectorOutputStream#getStream() getStream()};
 *   writeData(wrappedOutStream);
 *   wrappedOutStream.close();
 * 
 *   {@link Map}&lt;String, Object&gt; metadata = detectorOutStream.{@link DetectorStream#getMetadata() getMetadata()}; 
 *   Long bytesWritten = metadata.{@link Map#get(Object) get}("filesize");
 * </pre>
