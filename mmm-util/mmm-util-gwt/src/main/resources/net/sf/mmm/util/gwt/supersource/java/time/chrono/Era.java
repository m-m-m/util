/**
 * An era of the time-line.
 * <p>
 * Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras. However, some calendar
 * systems, have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader. In all cases, the era is
 * conceptually the largest division of the time-line. Each chronology defines the Era's that are known Eras
 * and a {@link Chrono#eras Chrono.eras} to get the valid eras.
 * <p>
 * For example, the Thai Buddhist calendar system divides time into two eras, before and after a single date.
 * By contrast, the Japanese calendar system has one era for the reign of each Emperor.
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@code Era} may be compared using the {@code ==} operator.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly. All implementations
 * must be singletons - final, immutable and thread-safe. It is recommended to use an enum whenever possible.
 * 
 * @param <C> the chronology of the era
