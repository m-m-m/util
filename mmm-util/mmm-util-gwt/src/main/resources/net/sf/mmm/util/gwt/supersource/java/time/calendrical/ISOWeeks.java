/**
 * Fields and units supporting the week-based-year defined by ISO-8601.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format, defining a string format for
 * dates and times. However, it also defines an alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of
 * week-based-year.
 * <p>
 * The date is expressed using three fields:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the day-of-week from Monday
 * (1) to Sunday (7)
 * <li>{@link #WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
 * <li>{@link #WEEK_BASED_YEAR WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year. It differs from the
 * standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
 * <p>
 * The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard ISO year that has at
 * least 4 days in the new year.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
 * <li>If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
 * <li>If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
 * <li>If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year
 * <li>If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th
 * <li>If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd
 * <li>If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" border="0" style="text-align: left; width: 50%;">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Date</th>
 * <th>Day-of-week</th>
 * <th>Field values</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2008-12-28</th>
 * <td>Sunday</td>
 * <td>Week 52 of week-based-year 2008</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2008-12-29</th>
 * <td>Monday</td>
 * <td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2008-12-31</th>
 * <td>Wednesday</td>
 * <td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2009-01-01</th>
 * <td>Thursday</td>
 * <td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2009-01-04</th>
 * <td>Sunday</td>
 * <td>Week 1 of week-based-year 2009</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <th>2009-01-05</th>
 * <td>Monday</td>
 * <td>Week 2 of week-based-year 2009</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
