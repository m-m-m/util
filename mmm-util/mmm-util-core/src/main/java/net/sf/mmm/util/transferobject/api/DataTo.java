/**
 * This is the abstract base class for an {@link TransferObject} that only contains data without relations.
 * This is called <em>DTO</em> (data transfer object). Here data means properties that typically represent a
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.lang.api.Datatype} and potentially for relations the ID (typically as {@link Long}).
 * For actual relations you will use {@link CompositeTo CTO}s to express what set of entities to transfer,
 * load, save, update, etc. without redundancies. It typically corresponds to an
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.entity.api.GenericEntity entity}. In such case consider {@link EntityTo}. Otherwise
 * if you derive from this class rather than {@link EntityTo} use the suffix <code>Dto</code>.<br/>
 * For additional details and an example consult the {@link net.sf.mmm.util.transferobject.api package
 * JavaDoc}.
