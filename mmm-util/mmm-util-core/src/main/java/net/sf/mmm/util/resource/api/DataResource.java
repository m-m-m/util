  /**
   * This method determines if this resource has potentially data {@link #isAvailable() available}. Unlike
   * {@link #isAvailable()} this method will not invoke expensive operations like connecting to remote URLs.
   * If this method will return <code>false</code>, then {@link #isAvailable()} would also have returned
   * <code>false</code>. However in case of <code>true</code> only {@link #isAvailable()} can guarantee if a
   * resource really exists and contains data. E.g. if the resource points to a {@link java.io.File} then this
   * method can check if it is a {@link java.io.File#isFile() data-file}. So in case it points to a directory
   * or does not exist at all in the filesystem, this method will return <code>false</code>. Please also note
   * that this may invoke expensive operations if the according directory path points to something like a
   * network share. You should also be aware that the state of {@link #isData()} and {@link #isAvailable()}
   * can change at any time so you never have a full guarantee if some data exists or NOT. However in most
   * cases it is very improbable that this status changes when you {@link #openStream() read} the resource
