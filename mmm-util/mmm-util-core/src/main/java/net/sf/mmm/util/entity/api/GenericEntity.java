/**
 * This is the interface for a (persistent) entity, which is an object that is potentially stored in a
 * persistent store (typically a database and via JPA). Every non-abstract implementation of this interface is
 * simply called an <em>entity</em> or <em>business-object</em>. It is supposed to be a simple java-bean or in
 * words a {@link net.sf.mmm.util.pojo.api.Pojo}.<br>
 * This interface makes the following assumptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link GenericEntity} is identified by a {@link #getId() primary key}.</li>
 * <li>A {@link GenericEntity} has a {@link #getModificationCounter() modification counter} for optimistic
 * locking (even though not strictly required - you could statically return 0).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * An instance of this interface can be one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a <b>{@link PersistenceEntity}</b><br/>
 * <li>a <b>{@link net.sf.mmm.util.transferobject.api.EntityTo transfer-object}</b><br/>
 * </ul>
 * In order to distinguish the above cases an application has an architecture that organizes the code in
 * technical layers (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture">multilayered
 * architecture</a>) and business oriented slices (business components). Therefore within the persistence
 * layer instances should always be {@link PersistenceEntity persistence entities} (independent from their
 * actual state such as {@link PersistenceEntity#STATE_MANAGED managed}). On the other hand in the higher
 * layers instances always need to be {@link net.sf.mmm.util.transferobject.api.TransferObject}s. Our
 * recommendation is to
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.transferobject.api.TransferObjectUtil#convertFromEntity(PersistenceEntity, Class)
 * convert} persistent entities into {@link net.sf.mmm.util.transferobject.api.EntityTo entity
 * transfer-objects} when exposing functionality in the API of the <em>logic</em> layer.
 *
 * @see javax.persistence.Entity
 *
 * @param <ID> is the type of the {@link #getId() primary key}.

  /**
   * This method gets the unique identifier (primary key) of this entity. While this method is initially
   * defined in a generic way, it is strongly recommended to use {@link Long} as datatype for IDs.<br/>
   * Even if you want to have a {@link String}-based business-oriented identifier it is best practice to use a
   * {@link Long} as primary key and add the business identifier as additional field (with a unique
   * constraint). This way references to the entity will be a lot more compact and improve your performance in
   * JOINs or the like. However, there may be reasons to use other {@link net.sf.mmm.util.lang.api.Datatype
   * datatypes} for the ID. In any case the unique ID should be an immutable java-object that can be rebuild
   * from its {@link Object#toString() string-representation}.<br/>
   * Please note that if your ID has a specific syntax, semantic, formatting rules, etc. you should create a
   * custom {@link net.sf.mmm.util.lang.api.Datatype} for it. If it can easily be mapped to a {@link Long}
   * value you can still use {@link Long} here and provide a transient getter method that returns the your
   * custom {@link net.sf.mmm.util.lang.api.Datatype} from the {@link Long}.
   *
   * @return the ID of this entity. It may be <code>null</code> if the object is
   *         {@link PersistenceEntity#STATE_NEW new} and no ID has manually been assigned.
