 * Provides the API for a search.
 * <a name="documentation"></a><h2>Search-Util API</h2>
 * This package contains the basic API for search related objects (
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.search.api.SearchCriteria} and {@link net.sf.mmm.util.search.api.SearchResult}). It aims to
 * standardize the API without requiring specific dependencies (e.g. to JPA or Lucene). The advanced support is
 * therefore located in separate modules like <code>mmm-persistence</code>. Instead, this API here may also be used by
 * transfer objects for clients and other stuff where the technology specific dependency should be avoided.
