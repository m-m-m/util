/**
 * This interface is used to document the concern <em>security</em> and track special support that we offer
 * for this purpose. In order not to reinvent the wheel, we do NOT create yet another security framework.
 * Instead we suggest to use <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">spring-security</a> and
 * support integration with it. However, there are some missing links that we aim to close with our project.
 * Have a look at the known subinterfaces and implementing classes to get an overview.
