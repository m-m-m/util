 * A set of date fields that provide access to Julian Days.

 * is expressed as a decimal number of whole days where days start at midday. This class represents variations
 * on Julian Days that count whole days from midnight.

  /**
   * Julian Day field.
   * <p>
   * This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number. Julian Day is a well-known system that
   * represents the count of whole days since day 0, which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian
   * calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian. The field has "JulianDay" as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'. The
   * field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.
   * <p>
   * For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.doGet()' assumes the same value from midnight until just before the next
   * midnight. When 'JULIAN_DAY.doWith()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains
   * unaltered. 'JULIAN_DAY.doWith()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.doGet()' only apply to {@code DateTime} objects that can
   * be converted into {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY}. A {@link DateTimeException} is thrown for any other type
   * of object.
   * <p>
   * <h4>Astronomical and Scientific Notes</h4>
   * The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day, thus 3.25 would
   * represent the time 18:00, since days start at midday. This implementation uses an integer and days
   * starting at midnight. The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at
   * midday of the date in question. This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer
   * {@code JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)}.
