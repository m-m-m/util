/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as
 * {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 * <p>
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone. This class stores all
 * date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds, a time-zone and zone offset. For example, the value
 * "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone" can be stored in a
 * {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 * <p>
 * This class handles both the local time-line of {@code LocalDateTime} and the instant time-line of
 * {@code Instant}. The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich, represented by
 * a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * <p>
 * Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the {@link ZoneRules rules}
 * accessed from the {@code ZoneId}. Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one
 * valid offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time is not
 * straightforward. There are three cases:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal case applies, where there
 * is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
 * <li>Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically due to the spring daylight
 * savings change from "winter" to "summer". In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
 * <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically due to the autumn daylight
 * savings change from "summer" to "winter". In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid
 * offsets.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an instant by obtaining the
 * offset has the potential to be complicated.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ZonedDateTime} effectively holds three objects internally, a {@code LocalDateTime}, a
 * {@code ZoneId} and the resolved {@code ZoneOffset}. The offset and local date-time can be combined to
 * define an instant. The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
 * <p>
 * Two methods, {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()}, help manage the
 * case of an overlap.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4> This class is immutable and thread-safe.
