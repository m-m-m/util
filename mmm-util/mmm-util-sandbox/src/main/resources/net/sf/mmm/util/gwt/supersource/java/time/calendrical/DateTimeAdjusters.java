/**
 * Common implementations of {@code DateTime.WithAdjuster}.
 * <p>
 * Adjusters are the principal tool for altering date-times. An adjuster should not normally used directly.
 * Instead it should be used as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   date = date.with(adjuster);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The adjusters provided by this class are primarily intended to be pre-packaged and pre-tested pieces of
 * business logic. They are especially useful to document the intent of code and often link well to
 * requirements. For example, these two pieces of code do the same thing, but the former is clearer (assuming
 * that there is a static import of this class):
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  // direct manipulation
 *  date.withDayOfMonth(1).plusMonths(1).minusDays(1);
 *  // use of an adjuster from this class
 *  date.with(lastDayOfMonth());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4> This is a thread-safe utility class. All returned adjusters are immutable and
 * thread-safe.
