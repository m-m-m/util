 * Provides the API for a persistence layer.
 * <a name="documentation"></a><h2>Persistence API</h2>
 * This package contains the API for a persistence layer. <br>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * This is not yet another O/R mapper or java persistence API (JPA) wrapper! <br>
 * The purpose of this API and its implementations is to help you writing a
 * structured and well designed persistence layer. The JPA is a perfect API for
 * the O/R mapping of your entities to a database. However, for any reasonable
 * business application you need to write a custom persistence layer on top of
 * the JPA with your entities, queries, data access objects (DAOs), etc. <br>
 * To support you with the design of your persistence layer this API and its
 * basic implementations will help you. If you do not like dependencies on this
 * code feel free to copy the ideas of this design into your own code. <br>
 * <br>
 * A major principle of this API is to establish a uniform structure as well as
 * generic access for your entities and DAOs. All your entities shall therefore
 * implement the interface {@link net.sf.mmm.util.entity.api.GenericEntity}
 * and all your DAOs the interface
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.persistence.api.GenericDao}.
 * The overall entry point is {@link net.sf.mmm.persistence.api.PersistenceManager}. <br>
 * For revisioning/auditing support there are also <code>Revisioned*</code>
 * extensions of the interfaces like {@link net.sf.mmm.persistence.api.RevisionedPersistenceManager}. <br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b><br>
 * After this code has been created we noticed the existence of
 * <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/jpa">spring-data-jpa</a>. This is a similar approach that you
 * can choose alternatively. However, it is doing a lot of magic. Therefore, we decided to continue with our approach.
 * You should also be aware that there are also additional features not offered by spring-data.
