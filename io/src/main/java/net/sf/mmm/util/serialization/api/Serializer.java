/**
 * This is the interface to {@link #serialize(Object) serialize} and {@link #deserialize(byte[]) deserialize}
 * arbitrary Java objects. As a default implementation we offer
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.serialization.base.JavaSerializer} but there can be many alternative implementations
 * like JSon, GWT RPC, etc. <br>
 * The call {@link #deserialize(byte[]) deserialize}({@link #serialize(Object) serialize}(o)) should have
 * behave like creating a deep-{@link Cloneable clone}. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * Not all objects can be {@link #serialize(Object) serialized}. By default they have to be compliant with
 * {@link java.io.Serializable}. However, specific implementations may have additional or alternate
 * requirements. E.g. for GWT (Google Web Toolkit) the object has to have a non-arg constructor (may be
 * protected) and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1054">shall not have
 * final fields</a>.
