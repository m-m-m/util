 * <h2>Util Serialization API</h2> Java offers a seamless serialization mechanism that allows to serialize any
 * {@link java.io.Serializable serializable} object to binary data ({@code byte[]}) and vice versa. However, there are
 * alternative solutions to Java serialization that offer some advantages like transparency by human-readable data (e.g.
 * as JSON) or better performance (e.g. by (generated) custom code). Therefore we offer a minimal abstraction of
 * serialization via the {@link net.sf.mmm.util.serialization.api.Serializer} interface.
