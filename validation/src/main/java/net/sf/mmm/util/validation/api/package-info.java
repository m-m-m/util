 * Provides the API for simple validation of values. <a name="documentation"></a>
 * <h2>Validator API</h2> Validation is a fundamental feature of an application. This package provides a simple but
 * powerful API for validation. While Java defines a very sophisticated API provided by {@code javax.validation} it is
 * overloaded for simpler use-cases or a limited web-application based on GWT. However, this API here can still act as a
 * thin facade to such validation framework. <br>
 * <h3>Validation and GWT (Google Web Toolkit)</h3> Techniques like GWT require specific limitations for your Java code
 * in oder to be executable as JavaScript on the client. These limitations shall not limit your validation on the
 * server-side but still allow to reuse logic on the client. I am aware that
 * <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-validation">gwt-validation</a> brings {@code javax.validation} to the
 * client. However, the price of this complexity is reduced turn-around times during development and therefore limit the
 * progress of your project.
