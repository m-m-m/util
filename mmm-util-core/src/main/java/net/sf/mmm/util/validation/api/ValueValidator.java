 * A {@link ValueValidator} allows to {@link #validate(Object) validate} according values. <br>

 * <b>NOTE:</b><br>
 * This API intentionally does NOT make use of {@link Throwable exceptions} as they are expensive to produce and shall
 * only occur in exceptional situations, while a validation failure is a regular use-case. Further, a validation shall
 * validate entire objects to the end collecting all {@link ValidationFailure failures} so the end-user can see and fix
 * all problems at once.
 *
 * @param <V> is the generic type of the value to {@link #validate(Object) validate}.
