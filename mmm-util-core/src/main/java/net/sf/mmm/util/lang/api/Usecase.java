/**
 * This annotation is used to associate code with usecases. A usecase is a functionality of the system that
 * can be performed by an end-user, an external system or automatically by the system itself. Typically the
 * implementation of a usecase contains aspects in different layers of the application and is not directly
 * reflected by grouping units such as modules or java packages. Therefore this annotation may be used to
 * identify which code belongs to a particular usecase. Therefore you should define a class, interface, or
 * enum with string constants for the names of your usecases. The javadoc of these constants shall provide
 * further documentation of the usecase like the detailed description or links to further documentation.
