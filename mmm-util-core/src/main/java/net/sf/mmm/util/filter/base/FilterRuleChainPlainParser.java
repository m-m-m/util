/**
 * This class allows to parse a list of including and excluding regex {@link PatternFilterRule}s and build an
 * according {@link FilterRuleChain}. The rules (include/exclude patterns) are proceeded in the order of their
 * appearance in the list. <br>
 * Here is an example of a configuration (rule list) parsed by this class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * # This file contains a filter-chain. Such chain is build of a list of 
 * # filter-rules. Each rule starts with a character that determines if an 
 * # inclusion (+) or an exclusion (-) is defined. This character must be followed
 * # by a regex pattern. To make it easier for you a simple pre-processing is 
 * # performed on the pattern string before it is compiled as 
 * # java.util.regex.Pattern:
 * # If the pattern does NOT start with "^" or ".*" the prefix ".*" is 
 * # automatically added. If the pattern does NOT end with "$" or ".*" the suffix
 * # ".*" is automatically appended.
 * # The pre-processing should safe you some typing and make it a little easier for
 * # users of the GNU command "grep".
 * #
 * # The filter-rules in the chain are processed in the order of their occurrence.
 * # The first rule that matches makes the decision according to the first 
 * # character (+/-).
 * # A list starting with the '#' character indicates a comment and is therefore 
 * # ignored. The same applies for empty lines.
 *  
 * # 1. rule says that all strings that start with "/doc/" will be accepted:
 * +^/doc/
 *  
 * # 2. rule says that all strings that end ($) with ".pdf" ignoring the case (?i)  
 * # of the characters will be rejected:
 * -(?i)\.pdf$
 * 
 * # 3. rule says that all string that start with "/data/" will be accepted:
 * +^/data/
 * 
 * # 4. rule says that all string that end ($) with ".xml" or ".xsl" ignoring the 
 * # case (?i) of the characters will be rejected:
 * -(?i)\.(xml|xsl)$
 * 
 * # 5. rule says that everything else is accepted
 * +.*
 * </pre>
