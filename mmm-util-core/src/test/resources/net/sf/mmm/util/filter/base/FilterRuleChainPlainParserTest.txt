# This file contains a filter-chain. Such chain is build of a list of 
# filter-rules. Each rule starts with a character that determines if an 
# inclusion (+) or an exclusion (-) is defined. This character must be followed
# by a regex pattern. To make it easier for you a simple pre-processing is 
# performed on the pattern string before it is compiled as 
# java.util.regex.Pattern:
# If the pattern does NOT start with "^" or ".*" the prefix ".*" is 
# automatically added. If the pattern does NOT end with "$" or ".*" the suffix
# ".*" is automatically appended.
# The pre-processing should safe you some typing and make it a little easier for
# users of the GNU command "grep".
#
# The filter-rules in the chain are processed in the order of their occurrence.
# The first rule that matches makes the decision according to the first 
# character (+/-).
# A list starting with the '#' character indicates a comment and is therefore 
# ignored. The same applies for empty lines.

# 1. rule says that all strings that start with "/doc/" will be accepted:
+^/doc/

# 2. rule says that all strings that end ($) with ".pdf" ignoring the case (?i)  
# of the characters will be rejected:
-(?i)\.pdf$

# 3. rule says that all string that start with "/data/" will be accepted:
+^/data/

# 4. rule says that all string that end ($) with ".xml" or ".xsl" ignoring the 
# case (?i) of the characters will be rejected:
-(?i)\.(xml|xsl)$

# 5. rule says that everything else is accepted
+.*
