/**
 * Provides the API for a generic event-handling.
 * <a name="documentation"></a><h2>Event-Util API</h2>
 * It is a common pattern to register a listener for events that notify of a 
 * specific situation. This pattern has been re-implemented thousands of times.
 * Java generics allow to stop to re-invent the wheel and implement the pattern
 * once in a generic way. This prevents you from typical mistakes as dead-locks
 * in listeners that want to de-register themselves during event-handling. <br>
 * Create your custom event by implementing the marker interface 
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.event.api.Event} or if suitable implementing
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.event.api.ChangeEvent}. Then the producer of the events 
 * only needs to extend {@link net.sf.mmm.util.event.base.AbstractEventSource} or
 * one of its sub-classes.
