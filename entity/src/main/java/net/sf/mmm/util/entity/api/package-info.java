 * Provides the API for a entities. <a name="documentation"></a>
 * <h2>Entity-Util API</h2> This package contains the API for {@link net.sf.mmm.util.entity.api.GenericEntity entities}.
 * It aims to standardize the API without requiring specific dependencies (e.g. to JPA). The advanced support is
 * therefore located in the separate module {@code mmm-persistence} while this API here may also be used by transfer
 * objects for clients and other stuff where a dependency to JPA and {@code mmm-persistence} is NOT desired.
