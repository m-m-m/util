 * Provides the API for a entities.
 * <a name="documentation"></a><h2>Entity-Util API</h2>
 * This package contains the API for {@link net.sf.mmm.util.entity.api.GenericEntity entities}. It aims to standardize
 * the API without requiring specific dependencies (e.g. to JPA). The advanced support is therefore located in the
 * separate module {@code mmm-persistence} while this API here may also be used by transfer objects for clients
 * and other stuff where a dependency to JPA and {@code mmm-persistence} is NOT desired.
