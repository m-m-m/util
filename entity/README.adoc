== mmm-util-entity

This module is part of the link:../README.adoc[mmm-util project] and brings generic support for dealing with (JPA) entities:

* http://m-m-m.github.io/maven/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/entity/api/package-summary.html#package.description[Entity API] containg well-documented interfaces for entities.
* http://m-m-m.github.io/maven/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/entity/base/package-summary.html#package.description[Entity Base] brings abstract base implementations of the API to extend your entities from.
* http://m-m-m.github.io/maven/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/transferobject/api/package-summary.html#package.description[Transferobject API] brings an API and concept to use the JPA in a reasonable architecture and solves problems such as sending the correct version (modification counter) even if the entity gets converted to a transfer object (ETO) before the transaction was committed.
* http://m-m-m.github.io/maven/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/util/value/impl/package-summary.html[Value converter implementations] to integrate with link:../pojo[mmm-util-pojo].

If you like the concepts but not the details of the implementation feel free to copy the ideas (as done in http://oasp.io/[OASP]).
