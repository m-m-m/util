 * Contains a temporary backport for functional interfaces from {@code java.util.function}. <a name="documentation"></a>
 * <h2>Util Lang API Function</h2> This package contains backports for the interfaces located in the package
 * {@code java.util.function} that have been introduced with Java 1.8. Initially it was our plan to use the proper
 * interfaces directly and create a backport with {@code mmm-util-backport-java.util.function}. <br>
 * However, it turned out that Java is so picky about its reserved {@code java} package that creating a backport for
 * earlier Java versions is technically possible but practically useless. All our users would need to add
 * {@code -Xbootclasspath} to all compilations and runtimes involved or need to "hack" their JVM. As this makes it
 * practically impossible to run the code in a predefined JEE environment we decided to go for "copies" in this package.
 * After Java 1.8 is widely established, we will derive these interfaces from the correct ones in
 * {@code java.util.function} and mark them as deprecated. In APIs that take such an interface we will replace it with
 * the correct one. Then users can migrate and remove the deprecations. In a later release we can then entirely remove
 * this package. <br>
