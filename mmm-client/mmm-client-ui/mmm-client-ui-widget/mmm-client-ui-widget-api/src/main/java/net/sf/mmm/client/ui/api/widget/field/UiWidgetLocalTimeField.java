/**
 * This is the interface for a {@link UiWidgetTextualInputField textual input field} that allows to display
 * and enter a value of the type {@link LocalTime} with hours, minutes and seconds. It should both support a
 * textual input field as well as a (icon-)button that opens a clock popup to pick the time from. If this
 * widget is not available by the underlying native toolkit, an implementation shall be provided that is based
 * on {@link UiWidgetTextField}. <br>
 * Here you can see an example (with {@link #setLabel(String) field label} "Departure"):
 *
 * <pre>
 * Departure: <input type="time" />
 * </pre>
