  /**
   * This method gets advanced visibility support. It allows you to read and write the visibility for
   * different cross-cutting concerns. <br>
   * <b>Motivation:</b><br>
   * Typical UI toolkits provide visibility as a primitive <code>boolean</code> attribute or property.
   * However, this is leading to various problems if you have multiple aspects that influence the flag. E.g.
   * assume you have some dynamic effect that is showing or hiding a widget. Additionally the widget is in a
   * collapsable section, tab-panel, or the like that is also showing or hiding the widget. Further, there
   * might be an authorization in your application as a cross-cutting concern that hides widgets from the UI
   * according to the current roles and permissions of the user. If this is all based on a simple boolean flag
   * you will end up in a mess and with a buggy application. So the dynamic effect or even worse the
   * authorization will hide the widget but after the user collapses and then expands a panel it becomes
   * visible again. You do not want to deal with bugs like this. <br>
   * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
   * The returned instance may be lazily created. It will not be expensive but for a large UI this will sum
   * up. In a web or especially a mobile client memory might be low. So if you are recursively traversing the
   * UI widget tree you should only rely on {@link #isVisible()} for reading visibility.
   * 
   * @return the {@link AttributeWriteFlagAdvanced mutable flag} for advanced visibility support.
