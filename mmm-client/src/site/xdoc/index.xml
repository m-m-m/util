    <section name="About mmm-client">
      This project provides infrastructure to build a rich client easier. There are many common 
    best practices to build a server application. However, building a (complex) client application
    is not so easy to do. With mmm-client we offer you the perfect framework to do so.
    This includes the the communication with the server using <a href="../mmm-service">mmm-service<a>
    as well as everything you need to build a user-interface by <a href="../mmm-client-ui">mmm-client-ui</a>.
    Have a look at our <a href="http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/images/Architecture.svg">technical architecture</a>
      to get started and also read the <a href="http://m-m-m.sourceforge.net/apidocs/net/sf/mmm/client/package-summary.html">JavaDoc</a>.
