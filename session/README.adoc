== mmm-util-session

This module is part of link:../../..#mmm-util[mmm-util] and brings a minimal shim to access login, locale, and other such data from a user session.
The implementation simply delegates to standards from spring and spring-security. However, this module allows that features from other modules are not hardwired against spring 
and may also be used in other contexts by providing an alternative implementation.
