== mmm-util-date

This module is part of link:../../..#mmm-util[mmm-util] and brings support for the legacy types `Date` and `Calendar` (esp. ISO 8601).
We recommend to use JSR310 (`java.time.*`) if possible. However, if you still have to use the legacy types, this library can help you.
For details read the JavaDocs:
