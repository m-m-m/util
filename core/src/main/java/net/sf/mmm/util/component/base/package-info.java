 * Contains base-implementation of component-util. <a name="documentation"></a>
 * <h2>Component-Util Base</h2> Provides {@link net.sf.mmm.util.component.base.InitializationState} that can be used to
 * implement a component that requires strict {@link javax.annotation.PostConstruct initialization} and wants to ensure
 * that some methods have to be called before and others after initialization. <br>
 * For components of this project that do NOT have to inherit from anything else, this package offers
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.component.base.AbstractComponent} and
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.util.component.base.AbstractLoggableComponent} to make writing components easier.
