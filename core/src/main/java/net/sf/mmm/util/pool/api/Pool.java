/**
 * This is the interface for a simple pool. It allows to {@link #borrow() borrow} an object from the pool. If that
 * object is NOT needed anymore, it should be {@link #release(Object) released}. <br>
 * A typical pool implementation will have an internal buffer to cache {@link #release(Object) released} objects so they
 * can be reused for further {@link #borrow() requests}. Such buffer should be limited to a maximum size (capacity).
 * While that size is reached, {@link #release(Object) released} objects will NOT be cached anymore (and the garbage
 * collector should free them). <br>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * Do NOT use this interface for a {@link Thread}-pool. There is already {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} for this
 * use-case (see {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors}).
 *
 * @param <E> is the templated type of the elements in the pool.
