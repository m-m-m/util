/**
 * This interface is only used for documentation of what is meant by the terms <em>IoC</em>. <br>
 * <em>IoC</em> is a shortcut for <em>Inversion of Control</em> that is an excellent design pattern supporting
 * <em>SoC</em> (separation of concerns). If a component <em>A</em> has a dependency on some other component <em>B</em>
 * it simply aggregates the interface of the other component B and typically offers a public setter taking the interface
 * of B as argument. This way the component A has no knowledge about how to instantiate or configure the component B.
 * Instead a central {@link IocContainer} manages all components and takes care of these dependencies and
 * {@link javax.inject.Inject injects} the instance of B into A. This process is called <em>dependency injection</em> (
 * <em>DI</em>). Therefore the implementation of component B can be replaced without touching component A. This pattern
 * is the key to a maintainable architecture. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Important:</b><br>
 * Please see {@link Cdi CDI} for the details how to realize the {@link Ioc IoC} pattern in Java.
