/**
 * This is the interface for a particular <em>enumeration</em>. An enumeration has a finite set of characteristics. This
 * can be a java {@link Enum} but also something more complex such as a dynamic enumeration that is configured via a
 * database. For this reason it is called {@link EnumType} rather than {@code EnumDatatype}. However, for convenience
 * and simplicity it extends {@link Datatype}. If you have an {@link Enum} with a
 * {@link EnumTypeWithCategory#getCategory() category} you will need to implement {@link EnumTypeWithCategory} for
 * according support. <br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b><br>
 * It is strongly recommended to use a {@link Datatype} or at least a transfer-object to represent the enumeration
 * instances. Using an {@link javax.persistence.Entity} as {@link EnumType} should be avoided.
 *
 * @deprecated over-engineered, not used or needed, will be deleted in a future release.
 * @param <V> is the generic type of the {@link #getValue() value}. This may be a simple datatype such as {@link String}
 *        or {@link Long} or this type itself implementing {@link EnumType}.
