/**
 * This is the interface for a particular <em>enumeration</em>. An enumeration has a finite set of
 * characteristics. This can be a java {@link Enum} but also something more complex such as a dynamic
 * enumeration that is configured via a database. For this reason it is called {@link EnumType} rather than
 * {@code EnumDatatype}. However, for convenience and simplicity it extends {@link Datatype}. For being
 * less invasive, also standard java {@link Enum}s are supported by {@link EnumDefinition}. Therefore it is
 * recommended but NOT technically required to implement this interface for your custom {@link Enum}s that
 * shall be supported by {@link EnumProvider}. If you have an {@link Enum} with a
 * {@link EnumTypeWithCategory#getCategory() category} you will need to implement {@link EnumTypeWithCategory}
 * for according support. <br>
 * <b>NOTE:</b><br>
 * It is strongly recommended to use a {@link Datatype} or at least a transfer-object to represent the
 * enumeration instances. Using an {@link javax.persistence.Entity} as {@link EnumType} should be avoided.
 * 
 * @param <V> is the generic type of the {@link #getValue() value}. This may be a simple datatype such as
 *        {@link String} or {@link Long} or this type itself implementing {@link EnumType}.
