/**
 * This is the interface for the node of a tree. The tree itself is defined by the <em>root-node</em> which is
 * its only {@link GenericTreeNode node} in the tree that has no {@link #getParent() parent}. <br>
 * A {@link GenericTreeNode} is generic and allows different types for {@literal <CHILD>} and
 * {@literal <PARENT>} (e.g. to implement a <em>folder</em> that can only have a <em>folder</em> as parent but
 * can have any <em>resource</em> as child that is of type <em>folder</em> or <em>file</em>). For a regular
 * simple tree node you can use {@link TreeNode}.
 * 
 * @param <CHILD> is the generic type of the {@link #getChildren() children}.
 * @param <PARENT> is the generic type of the {@link #getParent() parent}.
