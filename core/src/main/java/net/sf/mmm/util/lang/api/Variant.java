/**
 * This interface only exists for documentation of the concept of a <em>variant</em>. An operation may have a variant
 * that influences its behavior. This can be anything from a strategy (e.g. "bubble-sort" for a sort operation) to
 * something that causes additional steps to take place (e.g. "keep-backup" for a save operation). In general it is
 * recommended by making this explicit by different signatures with reasonable names. However, sometimes there is need
 * for generic code to call a single operation with different variants. In such case an additional argument can
 * represent which variant of the operation shall be used. This can be done in one of the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>take the variant as {@link Object} for ultimate flexibility and only link to {@link Variant} for documentation.
 * </li>
 * <li>take the variant as {@link Variant} to make it more expressive but also more invasive.</li>
 * <li>take a specific type (e.g. {@link Enum} or {@code Pojo}) as input that may implement this interface for
 * documentation purpose (but is not required to do so).</li>
 * </ul>
 * In any case you should avoid casting a given {@link Variant}. Instead, whenever possible use a simple type for
 * {@link Variant} such as an {@link Enum} or {@link String} (from a constant). Then you can do something like
 * <code>if (MyVariantEnum.SPECIAL == variant) { doSomethingSpecial(); } ...</code>. <br>
 * <b>ATTENTION:</b><br>
 * If not documented otherwise a {@link Variant} may always be {@code null} what is typically the default.
