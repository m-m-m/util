/**
 * This annotation is used to associate code with requirements. A requirement is a specific need a system has
 * to fulfill. Typically the implementation of a requirement contains aspects in different layers of the
 * application and is not directly reflected by grouping units such as modules or java packages. Therefore
 * this annotation may be used to identify which code belongs to a particular requirement. Therefore you
 * should define a class, interface, or enum with string constants for the names of your requirements. The
 * javadoc of these constants shall provide further documentation of the requirement like the detailed
 * description or links to further documentation.
