 * This interface is used to document the concept and meaning of <em>accessibility</em> (of a user-interface). We
 * provide advanced support especially via {@link #WAI_ARIA} within this project and via this marker interface you can
 * find the related spots. However, descriptive information such as meaningful alt-texts have to be defined by the
 * developers of actual UIs and can not be generated automatically by the framework. Please support people with
 * disabilities by enriching your application with semantical information - we already do our best to make this easy for
 * you. Have a look at the known subinterfaces and implementing classes to get an overview of our supporting code.
