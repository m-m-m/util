/**
 * This is the interface for a factory of {@link Collection}s. It allows to abstract from {@link Collection}
 * implementations. <br>
 * A {@link Collection} instance can be used for different purposes such as a set or a list or with different
 * aspects such as a thread-safe collection. If you write a generic component different users of that
 * component may expect different aspects of your component and therefore the underlying {@link Collection}. <br>
 * If you use this interface and allow the user to {@link javax.inject.Inject inject} an instance of this
 * interface to override the default, your code will increase usability. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Why passing a {@link CollectionFactory} rather than a {@link Collection} instance to the
 * constructor?</b><br>
 * Since java 5 you want to use generics for type-safe code. If these generic types change slightly over the
 * time of development (e.g. from <code>Class</code> to <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>) you would break
 * compatibility of the users of your code. Additionally you may want to express that the {@link Collection}
 * should be empty and/or NOT shared with others. Anyways the interface can obviously NOT guarantee this.
 * 
 * @param <COLLECTION> is the generic {@link Collection}-type.
